# Failures & Fixes (starter)

## Common
- **Too salty:** dilute with water/stock, add acid/sweetness carefully, serve with unsalted starch.
- **Flat flavor:** add acid (lemon/vinegar), add salt in small increments, add aromatics (garlic/ginger).
- **Mushy veg:** reduce cook time, increase heat, finish with fat + acid instead of over-roasting.
