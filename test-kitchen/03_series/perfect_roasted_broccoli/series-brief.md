# Series Brief: Perfect Roasted Broccoli

**Goal:** Roast broccoli that stays crisp-tender with browned edges, without drying out.  
**Dish/Protocol focus:** create a roast protocol separate from steaming.  
**Why now:** need a reliable alternative for when steaming feels too plain.  
**Constraints:** sheet pan only, weeknight timing.

## Variables to test
- Oven temp (425 vs 450)
- Oil amount (10 g vs 20 g per 500 g broccoli)
- Salt timing (before vs after)

## Metrics
- Browning level
- Interior tenderness
- Dryness
- Holding time (10–15 min)

## Plan
- run-01 baseline: 425°F, 15 g oil, salt before
- run-02: 450°F, same oil
- run-03: 450°F, salt after

## Stop condition
Two consecutive runs that hit “browned edges + tender interior” with no dryness.
