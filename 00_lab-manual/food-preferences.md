## Recipe Development Guidelines

When creating new protocols for this kitchen:

1. **Avoid** raw banana, fuzzy fruits, and almonds in all recipes
2. **Prefer** beef and pork for protein-forward dishes
3. **Include** leafy greens where possible (goal area)
4. **Lean into** umami-forward, Asian-inspired, or comfort food profiles
5. **Embrace** heat and spice; avoid bitter preparations
6. **Use** pantry staples (soy, mirin, sesame, rice vinegar) for weeknight convenience
7. **Sub** raw tomato with cooked/sauce forms when tomato flavor is needed
