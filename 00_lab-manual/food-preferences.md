## Allergies & Restrictions

**Oral Allergy Syndrome (OAS):**
- Raw banana
- Fuzzy fruit (peaches, nectarines, apricots, etc.)
- Almonds

> Note: Cooking typically denatures the proteins that trigger OAS, so cooked versions may be tolerable. Test cautiously.

**Texture/Taste Aversions:**
- Raw tomato (cooked tomato sauces are OK)
- Bitter flavors

## Recipe Development Guidelines

When creating new protocols for this kitchen:

1. **Avoid** raw banana, fuzzy fruits, and almonds in all recipes
2. **Prefer** beef and pork for protein-forward dishes
3. **Prioritize** sous vide, slow cooker, sheet pan, and baked methods — minimal active time
4. **Design for busy schedules** — low-effort, hands-off cooking
5. **Build hearty meals** — meat and potatoes style, high satiety
6. **Include** fiber sources and leafy greens where possible (goal area)
7. **Lean into** umami-forward, Asian-inspired, or comfort food profiles
8. **Embrace** heat and spice; avoid bitter preparations
9. **Use** pantry staples (soy, mirin, sesame, rice vinegar) for convenience
10. **Sub** raw tomato with cooked/sauce forms when tomato flavor is needed
11. **Include calorie estimates** — target 1800–2000 cal/day total
12. **Design for meal prep** — repeatable meals are fine, batch cooking encouraged
