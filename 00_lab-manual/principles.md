# Test Kitchen Principles
- **One variable at a time** when you’re iterating (especially in a Series).
- **Weights beat volume** for repeatability. Use grams when possible.
- **Write down constraints** (time, missing ingredients, equipment, guests).
- **Define success** before testing (taste, texture, ease, holding time).
- **Make notes while cooking** (a single line per step is enough).
