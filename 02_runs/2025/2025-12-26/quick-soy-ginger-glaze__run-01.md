**Tools:** saucepan, whisk  
**Prep / Cook / Total:** 5 / 7 / 12 min

## Context / constraints
Needed a fast glaze for chicken; no time for long reduction.

## What I changed vs last time
Baseline (first attempt).

## Ingredients actually used
As written, but used low-sodium soy.

## Process notes
Simmered 4 min before adding slurry; thickened quickly.

## Results
- Taste: strong, good punch
- Texture: glossy; slightly thicker than desired
- Ease / mess: easy, one pan
- Score (1–10): 8
- Would I serve to guests? yes

## Fixes / next hypothesis
- Reduce slurry by ~25% for a looser glaze.
