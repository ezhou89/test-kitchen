## Goal / Why this exists

Zero-thought, high-protein comfort food. Crispy spam, runny egg, hot rice, sriracha. Ready in 10 minutes if rice is already made. Perfect for "I don't want to think" nights.

## Ingredients

### Main
- 150–200 g cooked rice (from rice cooker)
- 85 g spam (about 3 slices, ~1cm thick)
- 2 large eggs
- 10 g butter or neutral oil

### Sauce/Toppings
- Sriracha or Kewpie mayo (to taste)
- Soy sauce (splash)
- Furikake (optional)
- Sliced scallions (optional)
- Toasted sesame seeds (optional)

## Method

1. **Heat skillet:** Medium-high heat, add half the butter/oil.
2. **Fry spam:** Add spam slices in single layer. Cook 2–3 min per side until crispy and caramelized. Remove to plate.
3. **Fry eggs:** Add remaining butter to pan. Crack eggs, fry to your preference (runny yolk recommended). Season with pinch of salt and pepper.
4. **Assemble bowl:** Hot rice in bowl. Arrange spam slices on one side, eggs on top.
5. **Finish:** Drizzle with sriracha and/or soy sauce. Top with furikake, scallions, sesame seeds if using.

## Success Criteria

- Spam is crispy on edges, caramelized (not soft/steamed)
- Egg yolk is runny (breaks over rice)
- Rice is hot

## Variations

- **Loco moco style:** Add hamburger patty and brown gravy
- **Breakfast version:** Add a drizzle of maple syrup on the spam
- **Korean twist:** Top with kimchi and gochujang instead of sriracha
- **Extra protein:** Use 3 eggs instead of 2

## Storage & Reheat

- Best made fresh — eggs don't reheat well
- Spam can be pre-sliced and stored; fry fresh when needed
- Batch-cook rice ahead of time
