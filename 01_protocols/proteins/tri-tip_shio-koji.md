# Protocol: Shio Koji Tri-Tip

**Category:** proteins
**Tags:** #beef #japanese-ish #high-protein #batch-prep #umami
**Version:** v0.1
**Servings / Yield:** 6-8 servings (from ~600-800g tri-tip slab)
**Prep time:** 5 min (+ 24-72 hour marinade)
**Cook time:** 60-75 min
**Tools:** sheet pan, wire rack, cast iron skillet, instant-read thermometer

## Goal / Why this exists

Shio koji is fermented rice with salt — it tenderizes meat through enzymatic action while adding deep, almost funky umami. The sugars caramelize into a beautiful mahogany crust. This is a "set it and forget it" marinade that transforms tri-tip into something that tastes way more complex than the effort involved.

## Ingredients (prefer grams)

**For the marinade:**
- 600-800g tri-tip, kept as a whole slab
- 80-100g shio koji (enough to coat all surfaces generously — roughly 10-12% of meat weight)

**For searing:**
- 15g (1 tbsp) high smoke-point oil (avocado or vegetable)

**Optional finish:**
- 5g sesame oil
- Sliced scallions
- Toasted sesame seeds

## Method (timed steps)

### Marinate (24-72 hours ahead)
1. **Pat tri-tip dry** with paper towels.
2. **Coat all surfaces** with shio koji, spreading evenly. Use your hands — get into the crevices.
3. **Place in a container or zip bag** (or vacuum seal if available).
4. **Refrigerate 24-72 hours.** 48 hours is the sweet spot — longer = more tender and funky. Don't exceed 72 hours or texture gets mushy.

### Cook Day
5. **Remove from fridge 30-45 min** before cooking. Gently scrape off excess shio koji — don't rinse, just remove the chunks. Some residue is fine and will caramelize.
6. **Preheat oven** to 250°F (120°C).
7. **Set tri-tip on wire rack** over sheet pan.
8. **Roast until internal temp reaches 115-120°F** (46-49°C) at thickest point. About 45-60 min depending on thickness.
9. **Remove from oven.** Rest 5 min while you heat the skillet.

### Sear
10. **Heat cast iron** over medium-high (not screaming high — the koji sugars burn easily).
11. **Add oil.** Sear tri-tip 1-2 min per side until deeply browned. Watch carefully — the sugars caramelize fast.
12. **Rest 10 min** before slicing. Internal temp will coast to 130-135°F.

### Slice
13. **Identify grain direction** — tri-tip has two grains meeting in the middle.
14. **Cut in half** at the intersection, then slice each half thin (5mm) against the grain.
15. **Optional:** Drizzle with sesame oil, top with scallions and sesame seeds.

## Success criteria

- Internal temp 130-135°F after resting (medium-rare)
- Crust is deep mahogany brown, slightly caramelized (not burnt)
- Meat is noticeably more tender than standard preparation
- Flavor is savory-sweet with umami depth — almost aged beef character
- No raw koji flavor (all cooked off)

## Variations

**Miso-Koji Hybrid:**
- Mix 60g shio koji with 30g white miso before marinating
- Even more umami, slightly sweeter crust

**Ginger-Scallion Finish:**
- After slicing, top with: 30g minced ginger + 40g sliced scallions + 30ml neutral oil heated until shimmering
- Pour hot oil over the ginger-scallion mixture on the meat — it sizzles and blooms

**Spicy:**
- Add 10g gochugaru to the shio koji marinade
- Or serve with a side of chili crisp

**Citrus Ponzu Finish:**
- Skip the sesame oil
- Serve with ponzu + grated daikon on the side

## Nutrition (approximate)

Per 115g (4 oz) serving:
- **Calories:** 190-210
- **Protein:** 26g
- **Fat:** 9-11g
- **Carbs:** 2g (from residual koji)

## Storage & reheat

**Refrigerator:** Sliced tri-tip keeps 4-5 days. The koji-treated meat actually holds moisture better than plain roasted.

**Reheating:**
- **Best method:** Warm slices in skillet over medium heat, 2-3 min. Add a tiny splash of water and cover to steam-heat without drying.
- **Cold:** Honestly excellent cold, sliced thin over rice or salad.

**Freezer:** Portion and freeze up to 3 months. Thaw overnight.

## Notes

- **Don't rinse the meat** — just scrape off the chunks. The thin residue adds flavor.
- **Medium-high, not high heat for searing** — koji sugars burn faster than you'd expect.
- **48 hours is ideal.** 24 hours works but less tenderizing effect. 72 hours gets very tender, almost soft.
- Shio koji is available at Japanese grocery stores or online (Cold Mountain, Hanamaruki brands). Once opened, keeps months in the fridge.
