**Cook time:** 8 hours (low) or 5-6 hours (high)
**Tools:** slow cooker (6-8 qt), cast iron skillet

## Goal / Why this exists

Transform boneless beef short ribs into meltingly tender, Korean-inspired braised beef. Gochujang and gochugaru provide layered heat, while soy, mirin, and Asian pear give that classic bulgogi-adjacent sweetness. Costco boneless short ribs are perfect for this — lots of marbling that renders out during the long braise. Ultimate hands-off batch cook.

## Ingredients

### Meat
- 1.3-1.8kg boneless beef short ribs (Costco pack is typically ~1.5kg)
- 10g kosher salt (Diamond Crystal)
- 5g black pepper
- 15 mL vegetable oil for searing

### Braising Liquid
- 120 mL soy sauce
- 60 mL mirin
- 45g gochujang (Korean red pepper paste)
- 15g gochugaru (Korean red pepper flakes) — adjust to heat preference
- 30g brown sugar
- 20g garlic (4-5 cloves), minced
- 20g fresh ginger, minced or grated
- 1 Asian pear, grated (~150g) — or substitute 80 mL apple juice + 15 mL rice vinegar
- 240 mL beef broth
- 15 mL sesame oil

### Aromatics
- 1 large onion (~200g), sliced into half-moons
- 4 scallion whites, cut into 5cm pieces (reserve greens for garnish)

### Optional Vegetables (add last 2 hours)
- 200g daikon radish, cut into 3cm chunks
- 150g carrots, cut into 3cm chunks

### Finish
- Scallion greens, sliced
- Toasted sesame seeds
- Extra gochugaru for heat

## Method

### Prep & Sear (20 min)
1. **Cut short ribs** into large chunks if needed (about 7-8cm pieces). Pat very dry.
2. **Season generously** with salt and pepper on all sides.
3. **Heat cast iron** over high heat until smoking. Add oil.
4. **Sear in batches:** 2-3 min per side until deeply browned. Don't crowd the pan. Transfer to slow cooker as you go.
5. **Sear onions:** In the same pan, add onion slices. Cook 3-4 min until charred on edges. Add to slow cooker.

### Build the Braise (5 min)
6. **Make braising liquid:** In a bowl, whisk together soy sauce, mirin, gochujang, gochugaru, brown sugar, garlic, ginger, grated Asian pear, beef broth, and sesame oil.
7. **Pour over meat** in slow cooker.
8. **Add scallion whites.** Nestle them around the meat.
9. **Do not stir** — let meat stay submerged in liquid.

### Braise (8 hours low / 5-6 hours high)
10. **Cook on LOW 8 hours** or HIGH 5-6 hours.
11. **Optional vegetables:** If adding daikon and carrots, add them 2 hours before end of cooking.
12. **Check doneness:** Meat should be fork-tender, falling apart with gentle pressure. Internal temp 200-210°F.

### Finish
13. **Skim fat** from surface if desired (or leave for richness).
14. **Taste braising liquid** — adjust with more soy (salt), gochujang (heat), or brown sugar (sweetness).
15. **Serve in shallow bowls** with plenty of braising liquid. Top with scallion greens and sesame seeds.

## Success Criteria

- Meat is fork-tender — falls apart without cutting
- Braising liquid is glossy and slightly thickened
- Good balance of sweet, salty, spicy, and umami
- Gochujang heat is noticeable but not overwhelming
- Deep reddish-brown color from the gochugaru

## Variations

**Extra Spicy:**
- Double the gochugaru (30g)
- Add 2-3 dried chiles de arbol to the braise
- Finish with extra gochugaru and chili oil

**Galbi-Jjim Style (more traditional):**
- Add 10 dried jujubes (대추)
- Add 10 ginkgo nuts
- Add 5 dried shiitake mushrooms
- Use bone-in short ribs if available

**Soy-Forward (less spicy):**
- Reduce gochujang to 20g
- Omit gochugaru
- Increase soy sauce to 150 mL

**With Glass Noodles:**
- Add 100g dried sweet potato noodles (dangmyeon) last 30 min
- Let them absorb the braising liquid

## Nutrition Estimate

## Storage & Reheat

**Refrigerator:** Keeps 5-6 days. The fat will solidify on top — this is fine. Flavors improve overnight.

**Reheating:**
- **Best method:** Stovetop in covered pot over medium-low, 10-15 min. The solidified fat will melt back in.
- **Microwave:** 3-4 min covered, stirring halfway.

**Freezer:** Portion with plenty of braising liquid. Freezes well 3 months. Thaw overnight in fridge.

## Serving Ideas

- **Over rice:** Classic — white rice or multigrain rice
- **With noodles:** Thick udon or sweet potato glass noodles
- **Lettuce wraps:** Butter lettuce cups with rice and pickled veg
- **Bibimbap base:** Use as the protein in a bibimbap bowl
- **Tacos:** Korean-Mexican fusion with kimchi and cilantro

## Notes

- Costco boneless short ribs are ideal — well-marbled and consistent size.
- The Asian pear acts as a tenderizer. Apple juice + rice vinegar is a fine substitute.
- Searing is optional but highly recommended — adds crucial flavor depth.
- The braise gets better the next day as flavors meld.
- If you want a thicker sauce, remove meat and reduce liquid on stovetop for 10-15 min.
