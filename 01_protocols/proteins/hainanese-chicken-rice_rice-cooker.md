**Prep time:** 15 min
**Cook time:** 45–60 min (rice cooker dependent)
**Tools:** rice cooker, small skillet or pot for sauces

## Goal / Why this exists

One-pot Hainanese-style chicken and rice with minimal effort. The chicken steams gently on top of the rice, staying tender while infusing everything with flavor. Perfect for batch prep — the sauces keep well and reheat is easy.

## Ingredients

### Rice & Chicken
- 300 g jasmine rice
- 450–500 g bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs (2–3 thighs)
- 3 g salt (for chicken rub)
- 2 g white pepper

### Aromatics (for rice)
- 15 g garlic (3–4 cloves), minced
- 10 g fresh ginger, minced
- 15 g neutral oil or rendered chicken fat
- 2 g salt
- 300–320 mL water or chicken stock (adjust per your rice cooker)

### Ginger-Scallion Sauce
- 30 g scallions (2–3 stalks), finely sliced
- 15 g fresh ginger, minced or grated
- 2 g salt
- 30 mL neutral oil, heated until shimmering

### Chili-Garlic Sauce (optional)
- 15 g sambal oelek or sriracha
- 5 g garlic, minced
- 5 mL rice vinegar
- 5 mL soy sauce

### For Serving
- Sliced cucumber
- Fresh cilantro (optional)
- Dark soy sauce or sweet soy (kecap manis)

## Method

### Prep (15 min)
1. **Rinse rice** until water runs mostly clear. Drain and set aside.
2. **Season chicken:** Pat thighs dry. Rub with salt and white pepper on all sides. Let sit while you prep aromatics.
3. **Prep aromatics:** Mince garlic and ginger for rice. Separately prep ginger-scallion sauce ingredients.

### Rice Cooker (hands-off)
4. **Bloom aromatics:** In a small skillet, heat oil over medium. Add garlic and ginger, cook 1–2 min until fragrant (not browned). Alternatively, add raw aromatics directly to rice cooker — less flavor depth but zero extra dishes.
5. **Assemble cooker:** Add rice to rice cooker. Pour in aromatic oil, salt, and water/stock. Stir gently.
6. **Add chicken:** Nestle chicken thighs skin-side up on top of rice. Do not submerge.
7. **Cook:** Start rice cooker on standard white rice setting. Do not open lid during cooking.
8. **Rest:** When cycle completes, let rest on warm setting for 10 min.

### Make Sauces (during cook time)
9. **Ginger-scallion sauce:** Combine scallions, ginger, and salt in a heatproof bowl. Heat oil until shimmering (but not smoking), pour over. It should sizzle. Stir.
10. **Chili sauce:** Mix sambal, garlic, vinegar, and soy sauce.

### Serve
11. **Check chicken:** Internal temp should read 165°F+ (74°C). If not done, close lid and continue on warm for 5–10 min.
12. **Rest and slice:** Remove chicken, rest 5 min, then slice or chop.
13. **Fluff rice:** Stir rice gently to distribute flavors.
14. **Plate:** Mound rice, top with chicken. Serve with ginger-scallion sauce, chili sauce, cucumber slices, and a drizzle of dark soy.

## Success Criteria

- Chicken skin is not raw/rubbery (won't be crispy, but should be cooked through and pleasant)
- Chicken meat is tender and juicy, not dried out
- Rice is aromatic, slightly oily, with distinct ginger-garlic flavor
- Internal temp 165°F+ (74°C)

## Variations

- **Crispier skin:** After rice cooker, broil chicken thighs 2–3 min skin-side up (optional extra step)
- **More greens:** Add bok choy or napa cabbage on top of chicken for last 10 min of cooking
- **Pork version:** Substitute bone-in pork chops; increase cook time slightly if very thick

## Storage & Reheat

- **Fridge:** Chicken and rice together in airtight container, 4 days
- **Sauces:** Ginger-scallion keeps 5–7 days refrigerated; chili sauce keeps 2 weeks
- **Reheat:** Microwave with a splash of water or stock to prevent drying. Or pan-fry sliced chicken to refresh.
