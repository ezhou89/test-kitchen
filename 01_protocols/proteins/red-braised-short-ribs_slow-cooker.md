## Goal / Why this exists

Hong shao (红烧) — "red cooking" — is the Shanghainese technique of braising in soy sauce, sugar, and aromatics until the meat is glazed and deeply savory. The sauce becomes dark, glossy, and impossibly rich. Short ribs take to this beautifully, absorbing the sweet-salty-aromatic braising liquid. Uses pantry staples you already have.

## Ingredients

### Meat
- 1.3-1.8kg boneless beef short ribs
- 15 mL vegetable oil

### Braising Liquid
- 120 mL soy sauce (regular, not light)
- 60 mL dark soy sauce (for color) — or use all regular soy
- 60 mL Shaoxing wine (or dry sherry)
- 45g rock sugar (or 40g brown sugar)
- 480 mL water or beef broth

### Aromatics
- 60g fresh ginger, sliced into coins (about 8-10 slices)
- 6 scallions, white parts cut into 5cm pieces (reserve greens)
- 6 garlic cloves, smashed
- 3 star anise
- 1 cinnamon stick
- 2 dried bay leaves
- 5g Sichuan peppercorns (optional — adds numbing note)
- 2 dried red chiles (optional — for heat)

### Finish
- Scallion greens, sliced
- Toasted sesame seeds

## Method

### Blanch (Optional but Recommended) (5 min)
1. **Blanch short ribs:** Place in pot, cover with cold water, bring to boil. Boil 3 min.
2. **Drain and rinse** under cold water to remove scum. Pat dry.
3. This step removes impurities for a cleaner sauce. Can skip if short on time.

### Sear & Aromatics (10 min)
4. **Heat oil in skillet** over high heat until smoking.
5. **Sear short ribs** in batches, 2-3 min per side until deeply browned. Transfer to slow cooker.
6. **Add ginger and scallion whites** to skillet. Cook 1-2 min until fragrant.
7. **Add garlic, star anise, cinnamon, bay leaves** (and Sichuan peppercorns/chiles if using). Toast 30 seconds.
8. **Deglaze with Shaoxing wine,** scraping up fond. Let alcohol cook off 30 seconds.
9. **Transfer everything** to slow cooker.

### Build the Braise (5 min)
10. **Add soy sauces, sugar, and water/broth** to slow cooker.
11. **Stir gently** to dissolve sugar and distribute aromatics.
12. **Meat should be mostly submerged.** Add more water if needed.

### Braise (8 hours)
13. **Cook on LOW 8 hours** or HIGH 5-6 hours.
14. **Check doneness:** Meat should be fork-tender, nearly falling apart.
15. **Remove star anise, cinnamon, bay leaves** before serving if desired.

### Optional: Reduce Sauce
16. **For thicker glaze:** Remove meat, strain sauce into pot, simmer 10-15 min until syrupy.
17. **Return meat to sauce** and coat.

## Success Criteria

- Meat is fork-tender, rich mahogany color
- Sauce is glossy, dark, and slightly thickened
- Sweet-salty balance — neither cloying nor over-salted
- Star anise and cinnamon are present but not overpowering
- No raw alcohol taste

## Serving Ideas

- **Over rice:** Classic — white rice absorbs the sauce perfectly
- **With noodles:** Wide rice noodles or hand-pulled noodles
- **Bok choy:** Blanched and served alongside
- **Steamed buns:** Shred meat, stuff in bao with pickled veg
- **Rice bowl:** With soft-boiled egg and steamed greens

## Storage & Reheat

**Refrigerator:** Keeps 5-6 days. The sauce may gel when cold — this is collagen and a sign of good braise.

**Reheating:** Stovetop over medium-low. The gelled sauce liquefies beautifully.

**Freezer:** Portion with sauce. Freezes well 3 months.

## Variations

**Five Spice Version:**
- Omit whole spices
- Add 5g five spice powder to braising liquid

**With Hard-Boiled Eggs (Lu Dan):**
- Add peeled hard-boiled eggs last 2 hours of cooking
- They absorb the braising liquid and become marbled

**With Daikon:**
- Add 300g daikon chunks last 2 hours
- Absorbs sauce and becomes silky

## Notes

- Dark soy sauce is for color, not saltiness. If you only have regular soy, the dish will be lighter in color but still delicious.
- Rock sugar gives a cleaner sweetness than granulated. Brown sugar adds molasses notes, also good.
- The sauce will thicken as it cools due to collagen. This is ideal.
- Blanching is optional but gives a cleaner final sauce.
- Leftovers improve overnight as flavors meld.
