# Protocol: Tri-Tip Confit

**Category:** proteins
**Tags:** #beef #batch-prep #high-protein #strange #low-mess
**Version:** v0.1
**Servings / Yield:** 6-8 servings (from ~400-500g tri-tip portion)
**Prep time:** 15 min (+ optional 4-24 hour cure)
**Cook time:** 3-4 hours
**Tools:** oven-safe pot or Dutch oven with lid, instant-read thermometer

## Goal / Why this exists

Confit is the technique of slow-cooking submerged in fat — traditionally duck legs in duck fat. Applied to beef cubes, you get impossibly silky, tender meat with concentrated beefy flavor. The cubes crisp up beautifully when seared later. This is a weird, old-school preservation technique repurposed as a batch-prep powerhouse.

## Ingredients (prefer grams)

**For the cure (optional but recommended):**
- 400-500g tri-tip, cut into 3-4cm (1.5") cubes
- 8g kosher salt (Diamond Crystal) — ~2% of meat weight
- 4g black pepper
- 4 cloves garlic, smashed
- 3-4 sprigs fresh thyme
- 2 bay leaves

**For the confit:**
- 400-600g fat — enough to fully submerge the cubes
  - **Best:** beef tallow (most beefy flavor)
  - **Also good:** duck fat, lard, or olive oil
  - Can mix fats (e.g., 50% tallow + 50% olive oil)

## Method (timed steps)

### Cure (optional, 4-24 hours ahead)
1. **Cut tri-tip** into 3-4cm cubes. Keep them uniform for even cooking.
2. **Toss cubes** with salt, pepper, garlic, thyme, and bay leaves.
3. **Refrigerate 4-24 hours** in a covered container. This seasons the meat deeply and draws out some moisture for better texture.

### Confit Day
4. **Preheat oven** to 225°F (107°C). Low and slow is the key.
5. **Remove garlic, thyme, and bay leaves** from the cured meat (or leave them in for more flavor — your call).
6. **Place cubes in oven-safe pot** in a single layer, not stacked.
7. **Melt fat** and pour over cubes until fully submerged. Everything must be covered.
8. **Cover pot** with lid or foil.
9. **Cook 3-4 hours** until meat is very tender when pierced with a fork. Internal temp should be 180-195°F — collagen has broken down but meat isn't falling apart.

### Cool & Store
10. **Let cool in the fat** to room temperature (30-60 min).
11. **Transfer to storage container** — cubes submerged in fat. The fat preserves the meat.

### To Serve (crisp & finish)
12. **Remove cubes from fat,** let excess drip off.
13. **Sear in hot skillet** (no added oil needed — residual fat is enough) until crispy on all sides, 3-4 min total.
14. **Season with flaky salt** if needed.

## Success criteria

- Cubes are tender throughout — fork slides in easily
- Texture is silky, almost creamy, not stringy
- After searing: crispy browned exterior, soft interior
- Deep beef flavor concentrated by the cure and slow cook
- Fat is infused with beef flavor (save it for cooking)

## Variations

**Spiced Confit:**
- Add to the cure: 5g cumin, 5g smoked paprika, pinch of cayenne
- Great for tacos or rice bowls

**Asian-Spiced:**
- Add to the cure: 2 star anise, 5g Sichuan peppercorns, 15g soy sauce
- Finish with sesame oil and scallions

**Garlic Bomb:**
- Confit 1 whole head of garlic cloves alongside the beef
- Mash the soft garlic cloves over the crisped beef

**Herb-Forward:**
- Add rosemary and sage to the cure
- More Provençal, pairs well with olive oil as the confit fat

## Nutrition (approximate)

Per 85g (3 oz) serving of crisped confit (most fat drips off during searing):
- **Calories:** 220-250
- **Protein:** 22g
- **Fat:** 14-16g
- **Carbs:** 0g

Note: Most of the confit fat stays in the pot — you're not eating all that fat.

## Storage & reheat

**Refrigerator:** Submerged in fat, keeps 2-3 weeks easily. The fat seals out air — this is an old preservation technique.

**Using the leftovers:**
- Pull out cubes as needed
- Sear to crisp and warm through
- The confit fat is incredible for frying eggs, roasting potatoes, or searing other meats

**Freezer:** Can freeze cubes (with or without fat) for 3+ months.

## Serving suggestions

- **Tacos:** Crisp the cubes, serve in corn tortillas with pickled onion, cilantro, salsa
- **Rice bowls:** Over rice with a fried egg and quick-pickled vegetables
- **Hash:** Cube potatoes, crisp in the beef fat, add confit cubes, top with eggs
- **Salad:** Surprisingly good warm over bitter greens (the fat mellows bitterness)
- **Ramen/noodle soup:** Drop cubes in at the end, let them warm through

## Notes

- **Submerge completely** — any exposed meat will dry out.
- **Low temp is key.** Above 250°F you're roasting, not confiting. The slow render of fat into the meat is what makes this work.
- **Save the fat.** Beef-infused tallow is liquid gold. Strain and refrigerate for future cooking.
- The cure step isn't strictly necessary but makes a noticeable difference in flavor depth and texture.
