# Protocol: Reverse Sear Tri-Tip

**Category:** proteins
**Tags:** #beef #batch-prep #high-protein #weeknight
**Version:** v0.1
**Servings / Yield:** 6-8 servings (from ~1kg / 2-3 lb roast)
**Prep time:** 10 min (+ optional overnight dry brine)
**Cook time:** 60-75 min
**Tools:** sheet pan, wire rack, cast iron skillet, instant-read thermometer

## Goal / Why this exists

Foolproof method for Costco prime tri-tip that delivers edge-to-edge medium-rare with a good crust. Hands-off oven time, minimal active cooking. Perfect for weekend batch prep — slices reheat well for weeknight meals.

## Ingredients (prefer grams)

**For the roast:**
- 900-1400g (2-3 lb) tri-tip roast
- 12g kosher salt (Diamond Crystal) — ~1 tbsp, or 1% of meat weight
- 4g black pepper — ~2 tsp
- 4g garlic powder — ~1 tsp

**For searing:**
- 15g (1 tbsp) high smoke-point oil (avocado, vegetable, or beef tallow)

## Method (timed steps)

### Dry Brine (optional but recommended)
1. **Pat dry** the tri-tip with paper towels.
2. **Season all sides** generously with salt, pepper, and garlic powder.
3. **Refrigerate uncovered** on a wire rack over a sheet pan, 2-24 hours. Overnight is ideal — develops a pellicle for better crust.

### Day-of (if skipping dry brine)
1. Season as above, let sit at room temperature 30-45 min before cooking.

### Reverse Sear
1. **Preheat oven** to 250°F (120°C).
2. **Set tri-tip on wire rack** over sheet pan, fat cap up.
3. **Roast until internal temp reaches 115-120°F** (46-49°C) at thickest point. This takes 45-60 min depending on thickness. Check at 40 min.
4. **Remove from oven**, tent loosely with foil, rest 5 min.
5. **Heat cast iron** over high heat until smoking, add oil.
6. **Sear tri-tip** 1-2 min per side until deep brown crust forms. Sear the edges briefly too.
7. **Rest 10 min** before slicing. Internal temp will coast to 130-135°F (medium-rare).

### Slicing
1. **Identify the grain** — tri-tip has two grain directions that meet in the middle.
2. **Cut the roast in half** at the grain intersection.
3. **Slice each half thin (5mm) against the grain** for tender bites.

## Success criteria

- Internal temp 130-135°F after resting (medium-rare)
- Edge-to-edge pink with no gray band
- Deep brown, crispy crust on exterior
- Slices tender when cut against the grain
- Juicy — resting was adequate if cutting board has some juice but meat isn't dry

## From Frozen Method (experimental)

**Status:** Untested — needs validation run

For batch prep: season multiple roasts, freeze individually, cook directly from frozen with no thaw.

### Prep (weekend batch)
1. **Season roasts** as normal (salt, pepper, garlic powder).
2. **Wrap tightly** in plastic wrap, then foil, or vacuum seal.
3. **Freeze flat** on sheet pan, then store. Keeps 3 months.

### Cook from frozen
1. **Preheat oven** to 200°F (93°C) — lower temp compensates for frozen start.
2. **Unwrap roast**, place on wire rack over sheet pan, fat cap up.
3. **Roast until internal temp reaches 115-120°F** (46-49°C). Expect 90-100 min for a 1kg roast. Check at 75 min.
4. **Rest 5 min**, then sear and slice as normal.

### Why this works
- The low oven temp gently thaws and cooks simultaneously
- Extended time still avoids the gray band (gentle heat transfer)
- No planning ahead — grab from freezer, cook same day

### Test variables to validate
- [ ] Actual time to reach 115°F internal from frozen
- [ ] Crust quality compared to fresh
- [ ] Moisture/juiciness compared to fresh
- [ ] Any texture differences

## Variations

**Korean-ish:**
- Replace garlic powder with 8g gochugaru (Korean chili flakes)
- After slicing, drizzle with: 15g soy sauce + 5g sesame oil + sliced scallions

**Umami bomb:**
- Add 15g soy sauce + 10g Worcestershire to the dry brine rub
- Reduce salt to 8g to compensate

**Coffee-chili rub:**
- Add 8g espresso powder + 4g ancho chili powder to base rub
- Good with a soy-ginger glaze drizzle

**Spicy (high heat):**
- Add 5g cayenne to base rub
- Finish with hot sauce of choice

## Nutrition (approximate)

Per 115g (4 oz) serving, trimmed:
- **Calories:** 180-200
- **Protein:** 26g
- **Fat:** 8-10g
- **Carbs:** 0g

A 1kg roast yields roughly 700-800g cooked meat (8 servings).

## Storage & reheat

**Refrigerator:** Sliced tri-tip keeps 4-5 days in airtight container.

**Reheating (weeknight assembly):**
- **Best method:** Warm slices in a skillet over medium heat with a splash of beef broth or soy sauce, 2-3 min. Keeps them juicy.
- **Quick method:** Microwave covered at 50% power in 30-sec intervals. Add a damp paper towel to prevent drying.

**Freezer:** Slice, portion into meal-prep containers, freeze up to 3 months. Thaw overnight in fridge.

## Serving suggestions

- Over rice with quick soy-ginger glaze
- With roasted potatoes and Brussels sprouts
- Sliced on salad with leafy greens for fiber goal
- In tacos/burritos with pickled onions
