**Version:** v0.1
**Created:** 2026-01-10
**Servings / Yield:** 4-6 servings (~600g cooked)
**Prep time:** 15 min + 30 min marinade (or up to overnight)
**Cook time:** 10-12 min
**Tools:** sheet pan, broiler, instant-read thermometer

## Goal / Why this exists

Transform flap meat (bavette) into tender, charred carne asada using a broiler instead of a grill. The loose grain of flap meat absorbs marinade beautifully, and high-heat broiling creates char without drying out the meat. Batch prep friendly — slice and portion for tacos, rice bowls, or salads all week.

## Ingredients

### Meat
- 700-900g flap meat steak (bavette)
- 8g kosher salt (Diamond Crystal)

### Marinade
- 60 mL soy sauce
- 30 mL lime juice (1-2 limes)
- 30 mL vegetable oil
- 20g garlic (4-5 cloves), minced
- 15 mL Worcestershire sauce
- 10g cumin, ground
- 5g black pepper
- 5g smoked paprika
- 5g dried oregano
- 2-3 chipotles in adobo, minced (or 15 mL adobo sauce for less heat)

### Optional Finish
- Fresh cilantro, chopped
- Extra lime wedges
- Sliced radishes
- Pickled jalapeños

## Method

### Prep & Marinade (15 min + resting)
1. **Trim flap meat** if needed — remove any silver skin or excessive fat.
2. **Salt the meat** on both sides. Let sit 10 min while making marinade.
3. **Make marinade:** Whisk together soy sauce, lime juice, oil, garlic, Worcestershire, cumin, pepper, paprika, oregano, and chipotles in a bowl or large zip bag.
4. **Marinate meat:** Add flap meat to marinade, turning to coat. Refrigerate minimum 30 min, up to 12 hours. Longer = more flavor penetration.
5. **Bring to room temp:** Remove from fridge 20-30 min before cooking.

### Broil (10-12 min)
6. **Position rack** 4-6 inches from broiler element. Preheat broiler to high.
7. **Prep sheet pan:** Line with foil for easy cleanup. Place a wire rack on top if you have one (better char, better drainage).
8. **Remove meat from marinade.** Shake off excess — don't wipe dry. Discard remaining marinade.
9. **Arrange on pan.** If flap meat is very long, cut into 2-3 sections for even cooking.
10. **Broil 5-6 min** on first side until charred and starting to caramelize.
11. **Flip carefully.** Broil 4-5 min on second side.
12. **Check temp:** Pull at 125-130°F for medium-rare, 135°F for medium. Meat will carry over 5°F while resting.

### Rest & Slice (10 min)
13. **Rest on cutting board** loosely tented with foil, 8-10 min. This is critical — don't skip.
14. **Slice against the grain** into thin strips (5mm). Flap meat has visible grain lines running lengthwise.
15. **Serve immediately** or portion for meal prep.

## Success Criteria

- Charred exterior with visible caramelization spots
- Pink interior (medium-rare to medium)
- Tender slices that aren't chewy — grain is cut crosswise
- Smoky-savory flavor with cumin and chipotle coming through
- Internal temp 130-140°F after resting

## Variations

**Korean-Style:**
- Replace marinade with: 60 mL soy sauce, 30 mL mirin, 20g gochujang, 15 mL sesame oil, 30g Asian pear (grated), garlic, ginger
- Finish with sesame seeds and scallions

**Citrus-Forward:**
- Add 30 mL orange juice to marinade
- Use 2 limes instead of 1
- Add 5g orange zest

**Extra Spicy:**
- Double the chipotles
- Add 5g cayenne to marinade
- Serve with salsa macha or hot sauce

Per serving (assuming 5 servings, meat only):

- **Carbs:** 2g

## Storage & Reheat

**Refrigerator:** Sliced meat keeps 4-5 days in airtight container. Store any juices with the meat.

**Reheating:**
- **Best method:** Quick sear in hot skillet, 1-2 min just to warm through. Don't overcook.
- **Microwave:** 1-2 min covered, but texture suffers slightly.

**Freezer:** Portion sliced meat into bags with juices. Freezes well 2-3 months. Thaw overnight in fridge.

## Serving Ideas

- **Tacos:** Corn tortillas, onion, cilantro, lime, salsa verde
- **Rice bowls:** Over white rice with pickled veg, avocado, fried egg
- **Burrito bowls:** Rice, black beans, corn, cheese, sour cream
- **Salads:** Over romaine with cotija, pepitas, chipotle dressing
- **Quesadillas:** With cheese and sautéed peppers

## Notes

- Flap meat is sometimes labeled "sirloin tip" or "bavette" — all the same cut.
- The loose grain means it absorbs marinade faster than denser cuts.
- Don't marinate longer than 12 hours — acid will start to break down texture.
- If you don't have a broiler, use highest oven heat (500°F+) or a very hot cast iron.
