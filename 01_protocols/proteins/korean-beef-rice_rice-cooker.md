## Goal / Why this exists

Quick bulgogi-inspired ground beef over rice. Sweet, savory, with a kick of gochujang heat. Uses ground beef for speed — no marinating, no slicing. Batch-preppable meat that reheats perfectly.

## Ingredients

### Beef
- 450 g ground beef (80/20 or 85/15)
- 15 g garlic (3–4 cloves), minced
- 10 g fresh ginger, minced

### Sauce
- 45 mL soy sauce
- 30 mL mirin (or 15 mL honey + 15 mL water)
- 15 g gochujang (Korean red pepper paste)
- 10 mL sesame oil
- 5 g brown sugar (optional, for more sweetness)

### Rice
- 300 g jasmine or short-grain rice, cooked in rice cooker

### Toppings
- 2 scallions, sliced
- Toasted sesame seeds
- 1 fried egg per serving (optional but recommended)
- Kimchi (optional)
- Sliced cucumber (optional)

## Method

### Prep (5 min)
1. **Mix sauce:** Whisk together soy sauce, mirin, gochujang, sesame oil, and brown sugar in a small bowl.
2. **Prep aromatics:** Mince garlic and ginger.

### Cook Beef (10 min)
3. **Brown beef:** Heat large skillet over medium-high. Add ground beef, break into crumbles. Cook 5–6 min until browned and no longer pink. Don't drain — keep the fat for flavor.
4. **Add aromatics:** Push beef to sides, add garlic and ginger to center. Cook 30 seconds until fragrant.
5. **Add sauce:** Pour sauce over beef. Stir to combine. Simmer 2–3 min until sauce thickens slightly and coats the meat.
6. **Taste and adjust:** Add more gochujang for heat, soy for salt, or a splash of water if too thick.

### Assemble
7. **Bowl it:** Hot rice in bowl, top with beef and sauce.
8. **Finish:** Add scallions, sesame seeds, fried egg, kimchi, cucumber as desired.

## Success Criteria

- Beef is well-browned with some crispy bits
- Sauce is glossy and coats the meat (not watery, not dry)
- Good balance of sweet, salty, and spicy
- Gochujang heat is present but not overwhelming

## Variations

- **Spicier:** Add 1–2 tsp gochugaru (Korean red pepper flakes) or extra gochujang
- **Steak version:** Use thinly sliced ribeye or sirloin instead of ground beef
- **Low-carb:** Serve over cauliflower rice or lettuce cups
- **Bibimbap style:** Add sautéed spinach, bean sprouts, julienned carrots, and top with gochujang

## Storage & Reheat

- **Beef (fridge):** 4–5 days in airtight container
- **Beef (freezer):** 2–3 months, portion into bags
- **Reheat:** Microwave or skillet with splash of water to loosen sauce
- Rice keeps separately, 4–5 days fridge
