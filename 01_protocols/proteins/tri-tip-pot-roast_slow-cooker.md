**Category:** proteins
**Tags:** #beef #slow-cooker #batch-prep #high-protein #comfort-food
**Version:** v0.1
**Servings / Yield:** 6-8 servings (from ~500g tri-tip portion)
**Prep time:** 20 min
**Cook time:** 6-8 hours (low) or 4-5 hours (high)
**Tools:** slow cooker (6-8 qt), cast iron skillet, instant-read thermometer

## Goal / Why this exists

Transform tri-tip from a slicing roast into fork-tender, pull-apart pot roast. Tri-tip is leaner than chuck but the long braise breaks down connective tissue while the vegetables and braising liquid keep it moist. Perfect hands-off weekend batch cook.

## Ingredients (prefer grams)

**For the meat:**
- 450-600g tri-tip, cut into 3-4 large chunks (fist-sized)
- 10g kosher salt (Diamond Crystal)
- 4g black pepper
- 15g (1 tbsp) vegetable oil for searing

**For the braise:**
- 1 large onion (~200g), quartered
- 4 cloves garlic, smashed
- 3 carrots (~200g), cut into 5cm chunks
- 3 celery stalks (~150g), cut into 5cm chunks
- 450g baby potatoes or Yukon gold, halved (optional)
- 240ml (1 cup) beef broth
- 60ml (¼ cup) soy sauce
- 30ml (2 tbsp) Worcestershire sauce
- 15ml (1 tbsp) tomato paste
- 2 sprigs fresh thyme or 2g dried
- 2 bay leaves

## Method (timed steps)

### Prep & Sear
1. **Cut tri-tip** into 3-4 large chunks, roughly fist-sized. Pat dry.
2. **Season generously** with salt and pepper on all sides.
3. **Heat cast iron** over high heat until smoking. Add oil.
4. **Sear chunks** 2-3 min per side until deep brown crust. Work in batches if needed — don't crowd. Transfer to slow cooker.

### Build the Braise
5. **Reduce heat to medium.** Add onions to the same skillet, scraping up fond.
6. **Cook onions** 3-4 min until slightly softened and picking up color.
7. **Add garlic, tomato paste.** Stir 1 min until fragrant.
8. **Deglaze with beef broth,** scraping all the good bits.
9. **Pour skillet contents** over the meat in slow cooker.
10. **Add** soy sauce, Worcestershire, thyme, bay leaves.
11. **Nestle carrots, celery, and potatoes** around the meat.

### Braise
12. **Cook on LOW 6-8 hours** or HIGH 4-5 hours. Meat is done when it shreds easily with a fork and internal temp is 195-205°F.
13. **Remove bay leaves and thyme stems** before serving.

### Finish
14. **Taste braising liquid** — adjust salt if needed.
15. **Shred or chunk the meat** as desired. Serve with vegetables and plenty of the braising liquid.

## Success criteria

- Meat shreds easily with fork — no knife needed
- Internal temp 195-205°F (collagen fully broken down)
- Braising liquid is deeply savory (soy + Worcestershire do the work)
- Vegetables soft but not disintegrated
- No dryness despite tri-tip being leaner than chuck

## Variations

**Asian-Style:**
- Replace Worcestershire with 30ml mirin
- Add 15g fresh ginger, sliced
- Add 1 star anise
- Finish with sliced scallions and sesame oil

**Spicy:**
- Add 2-3 dried chiles de arbol or 5g gochugaru to the braise
- Finish with hot sauce

**Beer Braise:**
- Replace half the beef broth with dark beer (stout or porter)
- Adds malty depth

- **Calories:** 280-320
- **Protein:** 28g
- **Fat:** 12g
- **Carbs:** 12g (from vegetables)

With potatoes, add ~80 calories per serving.

## Storage & reheat

**Refrigerator:** Keeps 5 days in airtight container with braising liquid. Actually improves overnight as flavors meld.

**Reheating:**
- **Best method:** Stovetop in a covered pot over medium-low, adding a splash of broth if needed. 10-15 min until heated through.
- **Quick method:** Microwave covered, 2-3 min, stirring halfway.

**Freezer:** Portion with liquid into containers. Freezes well for 3 months. Thaw overnight in fridge.

## Notes

- Tri-tip is leaner than chuck, so don't skip the sear — it adds crucial flavor.
- Keep the chunks large; they'll shrink during braising.
- The soy sauce + Worcestershire combo gives deep umami without needing wine.
