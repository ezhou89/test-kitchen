## Goal / Why this exists

Rich, deeply spiced Mexican beef stew with a consommé that's almost better than the meat itself. Dried chiles provide complex heat without raw bitterness. The fat renders into the braising liquid, creating that signature red-orange consommé for dipping. Boneless short ribs shred perfectly. Makes enough for quesabirria tacos, ramen, rice bowls — the consommé is endlessly useful.

## Ingredients

### Dried Chiles
- 4 guajillo chiles (~30g), stemmed and seeded
- 3 ancho chiles (~25g), stemmed and seeded
- 2 chiles de arbol (~3g), stemmed — adjust for heat

### Meat
- 1.5-2kg boneless beef short ribs
- 10g kosher salt (Diamond Crystal)
- 5g black pepper
- 15 mL vegetable oil

### Aromatics & Spices
- 1 medium white onion (~200g), quartered
- 6 garlic cloves
- 10g cumin seeds (or 8g ground cumin)
- 5g Mexican oregano (or regular oregano)
- 3 whole cloves
- 1 cinnamon stick (or 3g ground cinnamon)
- 5g black peppercorns
- 2g ground ginger
- 480 mL beef broth
- 30 mL apple cider vinegar

### Finish
- Fresh cilantro, chopped
- White onion, diced
- Lime wedges

## Method

### Toast & Rehydrate Chiles (15 min)
1. **Toast chiles** in dry skillet over medium heat, 30 seconds per side until fragrant and pliable. Don't burn — they go bitter fast.
2. **Boil 500 mL water.** Remove from heat.
3. **Submerge toasted chiles** in hot water. Cover and soak 15-20 min until soft.

### Toast Spices & Blend (10 min)
4. **Toast cumin seeds, cloves, peppercorns, and cinnamon** in dry skillet 1-2 min until fragrant. Let cool.
5. **Blend rehydrated chiles** with 240 mL of their soaking liquid, toasted spices, garlic, oregano, ginger, and apple cider vinegar. Blend until completely smooth, 2-3 min.
6. **Strain through fine mesh** if you want silky-smooth consommé. Optional but recommended.

### Sear & Build (10 min)
7. **Season short ribs** generously with salt and pepper.
8. **Sear in batches** in hot oiled skillet, 2-3 min per side until browned. Transfer to slow cooker.
9. **Add quartered onion** to skillet, char 2-3 min. Add to slow cooker.
10. **Pour chile paste** over meat in slow cooker.
11. **Add beef broth.** Stir gently to distribute.

### Braise (8 hours)
12. **Cook on LOW 8 hours** or HIGH 5-6 hours.
13. **Meat is done** when it shreds with no resistance and internal temp hits 200-210°F.
14. **Shred meat** with two forks directly in the pot.
15. **Skim fat** from consommé if desired, or leave for richness.

### Finish
16. **Taste consommé** — adjust salt if needed.
17. **Serve meat** with consommé on the side for dipping.
18. **Garnish** with cilantro, diced onion, lime.

## Success Criteria

## Storage & Reheat

**Refrigerator:** Keeps 5-6 days. Fat solidifies on top — this is the good stuff for quesabirria.

**Reheating:** Stovetop in covered pot. The fat melts back in beautifully.

**Freezer:** Portion meat with consommé. Freezes 3 months.

**Consommé:** Can be frozen separately and used as a broth base for other dishes.

## Notes

- The chile blend is flexible. More guajillo = fruitier. More ancho = earthier. More arbol = hotter.
- Don't skip toasting the chiles — it develops the flavor significantly.
- The fat layer on top of the consommé is essential for quesabirria. Don't skim it all.
- Straining the chile paste is optional but gives a cleaner consommé.
- This recipe scales well — double it for meal prep.
