**Tags:** #beef #slow-cooker #batch-prep #high-protein #comfort-food #low-mess
**Version:** v0.1
**Created:** 2026-01-11
**Servings / Yield:** 6-8 servings
**Prep time:** 5 min
**Cook time:** 8 hours (low) or 5-6 hours (high)
**Tools:** slow cooker (6-8 qt)

## Goal / Why this exists

The laziest possible braise that still delivers. Tangy pepperoncini, butter richness, and ranch seasoning create a surprisingly complex flavor with almost zero effort. Boneless short ribs shred beautifully. This is "dump and forget" cooking at its finest — 5 minutes of prep for a week of sandwiches and bowls.

## Ingredients

### Required
- 1.3-1.8kg boneless beef short ribs (Costco pack)
- 1 packet (28g) ranch seasoning mix (Hidden Valley)
- 1 jar (450g) pepperoncini peppers, with brine
- 115g unsalted butter (1 stick)

### Optional
- 1 packet (28g) au jus gravy mix — adds depth, not essential
- 4-6 garlic cloves, smashed — if you want more savory backbone

## Method

1. **Place short ribs** in slow cooker. No need to sear, cut, or season.
2. **Sprinkle ranch packet** evenly over meat.
3. **Add au jus packet** if using.
4. **Pour entire jar of pepperoncini** over meat, brine and all.
5. **Place butter** on top.
6. **Cover and cook** on LOW 8 hours or HIGH 5-6 hours.
7. **Shred with two forks** directly in the pot. Meat should fall apart effortlessly.
8. **Stir to combine** shredded meat with the braising liquid.

## Success Criteria

- Meat shreds with zero resistance
- Tangy, buttery, savory flavor profile
- Liquid is rich but not greasy (butter emulsifies into the brine)
- Pepperoncini flavor is present but not overwhelming

## Serving Ideas

- **Sandwiches:** Crusty roll, provolone, extra pepperoncini
- **Rice bowls:** Over white rice with pickled onions
- **Tacos:** Flour tortillas, queso fresco, cilantro
- **Loaded potatoes:** Over baked potato with sour cream
- **Low-carb:** Lettuce wraps or over cauliflower mash

## Storage & Reheat

**Refrigerator:** Keeps 5-6 days. Fat will solidify — this is fine, melts on reheating.

**Reheating:** Microwave 2-3 min or stovetop in covered pan with splash of water.

**Freezer:** Freezes well 3 months. Portion with liquid.

## Notes

- This recipe is controversial in cooking circles for using packets. It works. Don't overthink it.
- The pepperoncini brine is essential — don't drain it.
- Butter amount can be reduced to 60g if you want less richness.
- No salt needed — ranch packet and pepperoncini brine provide plenty.
- Some versions add a stick of pepperoncini stems-on for presentation. Unnecessary.
