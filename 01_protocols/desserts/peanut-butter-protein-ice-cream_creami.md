## Nutrition (per serving, ~120g)
- **Calories:** ~150
- **Protein:** ~18g
- **Carbs:** ~8g
- **Fat:** ~6g

## Ingredients
- 200g whole milk
- 45g peanut butter (natural, no added sugar)
- 45g vanilla protein powder (~1.5 scoops, casein or blend preferred)
- 20g granulated sweetener (monk fruit or allulose)
- Pinch kosher salt

## Method
1. **Blend** milk and peanut butter first until fully emulsified.
2. **Add** protein powder, sweetener, and salt. Blend until smooth.
3. **Pour** into Ninja Creami pint container to max fill line.
4. **Freeze** for 24 hours minimum. Must be frozen solid.
5. **Process** on ICE CREAM setting. The fat content usually gives great texture on first spin.
6. **Serve immediately** for soft-serve, or freeze 1–2 hours for scoopable.

## Success criteria
- Rich peanut butter flavor throughout
- Creamy, smooth texture (PB fat prevents iciness)
- No protein chalkiness

## Variations
- **PB&J swirl:** Swirl in 30g sugar-free strawberry jam after processing
- **Chocolate PB:** Add 15g cocoa powder
- **PB Cup:** Mix in 30g chopped sugar-free chocolate after processing

## Storage & reheat
- Keeps in freezer up to 2 weeks
- RE-SPIN if frozen solid; PB content helps it stay softer than other protein bases
