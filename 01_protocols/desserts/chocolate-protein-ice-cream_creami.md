- **Protein:** ~20g
- **Carbs:** ~8g
- **Fat:** ~2g

## Ingredients
- 240g whole milk (or unsweetened oat milk for fewer calories)
- 60g chocolate protein powder (~2 scoops, casein or blend preferred)
- 15g unsweetened cocoa powder
- 20g granulated sweetener (monk fruit or allulose)
- 2g instant espresso powder (optional, deepens chocolate flavor)
- Pinch kosher salt

## Method
1. **Combine** all ingredients in a blender or shaker bottle. Blend until completely smooth with no powder clumps.
2. **Pour** into Ninja Creami pint container. Liquid should reach the max fill line.
3. **Freeze** for 24 hours minimum (overnight works). Must be frozen solid.
4. **Process** on ICE CREAM setting. If too thick or icy, run RE-SPIN once.
5. **Serve immediately** for soft-serve texture, or return to freezer 1–2 hours for scoopable consistency.

## Success criteria
- Smooth, creamy texture without ice crystals
- Rich chocolate flavor, not chalky or protein-y
- Scoopable after brief re-freeze

## Variations
- **Double chocolate:** Add 20g sugar-free chocolate chips before processing
- **Mocha:** Increase espresso powder to 4g
- **Mint chocolate:** Add 1/4 tsp peppermint extract

## Storage & reheat
- Keeps in freezer up to 2 weeks in Creami pint
