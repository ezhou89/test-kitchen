**Version:** v0.1
**Servings / Yield:** 1 pint (4 servings, ~120g each)
**Prep time:** 5 min
**Freeze time:** 24 hours
**Tools:** Ninja Creami, blender

## Goal / Why this exists
Bright, fruity strawberry ice cream with high protein. Uses frozen strawberries for convenience and intense berry flavor without the iciness that fresh fruit can cause.

## Nutrition (per serving, ~120g)
- **Calories:** ~100
- **Protein:** ~17g
- **Carbs:** ~10g
- **Fat:** ~1g

## Ingredients
- 180g whole milk
- 100g frozen strawberries (thawed slightly, ~10 min at room temp)
- 45g vanilla protein powder (~1.5 scoops, casein or blend preferred)
- 15g granulated sweetener (monk fruit or allulose)
- 5g fresh lemon juice (brightens berry flavor)
- Pinch kosher salt

## Method
1. **Blend** milk and thawed strawberries until smooth. Some small berry pieces are OK.
2. **Add** protein powder, sweetener, lemon juice, and salt. Blend until fully combined.
3. **Pour** into Ninja Creami pint container to max fill line.
4. **Freeze** for 24 hours minimum. Must be frozen solid.
5. **Process** on ICE CREAM setting. May need RE-SPIN due to fruit fiber.
6. **Serve immediately** for best texture.

## Success criteria
- Bright strawberry flavor, not artificial-tasting
- Pink color throughout
- Smooth with occasional berry flecks (not chunky ice)

## Variations
- **Strawberry cheesecake:** Add 30g softened cream cheese before blending
- **Berry medley:** Replace half the strawberries with frozen raspberries
- **Strawberry shortcake:** Mix in 30g crushed vanilla wafers after processing

## Storage & reheat
- Keeps in freezer up to 2 weeks
- Fruit-based recipes freeze harder; let sit 10 min + RE-SPIN before serving
