**Prep time:** 15 min

**Tools:** rice cooker

## Goal / Why this exists

Japanese mixed rice where everything cooks together — rice absorbs savory dashi-soy broth while toppings steam on top. Dump, press start, walk away. Great for batch prep and reheats well.

## Ingredients

### Rice Base
- 300 g short-grain or medium-grain rice (Japanese rice preferred, jasmine works)
- 280 mL water (slightly less than usual — toppings release liquid)
- 30 mL soy sauce
- 15 mL mirin
- 5 mL sesame oil
- 2 g dashi powder (or 1/2 tsp hon-dashi)

### Toppings (mix and match ~200g total)
- 100 g shiitake mushrooms, sliced (fresh or rehydrated dried)
- 100 g boneless chicken thigh, cut into 2cm pieces
- 50 g carrot, julienned or diced small
- 30 g aburaage (fried tofu pouch), sliced thin (optional)

### Finishing
- 2 scallions, sliced thin
- Toasted sesame seeds
- Shichimi togarashi (optional, for heat)

## Method

### Prep (15 min)
1. **Rinse rice** until water runs mostly clear. Drain well.
2. **Prep toppings:** Slice shiitakes, cut chicken into bite-size pieces, julienne carrots.
3. **Season chicken:** Toss chicken pieces with a splash of soy sauce (5 mL) while prepping.

### Rice Cooker (hands-off)
4. **Build the pot:** Add rice to rice cooker. Pour in water, soy sauce, mirin, sesame oil, and dashi powder. Stir gently to dissolve.
5. **Layer toppings:** Arrange shiitakes, chicken, carrots, and aburaage on top of rice. Do not stir — keep toppings on surface so they steam.
6. **Cook:** Start rice cooker on standard white rice setting.
7. **Rest:** When cycle completes, let rest 10 min on warm setting.

### Finish
8. **Fold and serve:** Gently fold toppings into rice, distributing evenly. Taste — adjust with a splash more soy if needed.
9. **Garnish:** Top with scallions, sesame seeds, and shichimi if using.

## Success Criteria

- Rice is fluffy with distinct grains, slightly sticky, not mushy
- Soy-dashi flavor throughout, not bland
- Chicken cooked through (165°F / 74°C)
- Mushrooms tender, carrots softened but not mush

## Variations

- **Pork version:** Swap chicken for thinly sliced pork belly or shoulder
- **Vegetarian:** Skip chicken, double mushrooms, add edamame after cooking
- **Autumn style:** Add ginkgo nuts, chestnut pieces, or sweet potato cubes
- **Seafood:** Use diced salmon or canned mackerel instead of chicken

## Storage & Reheat

- **Fridge:** 4 days in airtight container
- **Freezer:** Portion into containers, freeze up to 1 month
- **Reheat:** Microwave with damp paper towel over top, or steam in rice cooker
