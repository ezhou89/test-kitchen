## Goal / Why this exists
Fast, comforting meal when you have leftover rice and need something warm and satisfying with minimal effort. Perfect for using up batch-prepped proteins. Classic Japanese comfort food — umami-forward, soothing, endlessly customizable.

## Ingredients (per serving)

### Base
- 200 g cooked rice (leftover or fresh, any variety)
- 240 mL hot liquid (see options below)

### Broth Options (pick one)
1. **Dashi-style (recommended):** 240 mL hot water + 5 g dashi powder (or 1/2 tsp hon-dashi)
2. **Soy broth:** 240 mL hot water + 15 mL soy sauce + 5 mL mirin
3. **Green tea:** 240 mL brewed green tea (hojicha or genmaicha work great) + 5 mL soy sauce
4. **Chicken bouillon:** 240 mL hot water + chicken bouillon to taste + splash of soy sauce

### Protein Toppings (pick one, 60–100 g)
- Salted salmon (shake) — flaked, skin-on broiled or pan-fried
- Leftover tri-tip or pot roast — thinly sliced
- Leftover chicken thigh — shredded
- Canned salmon — drained and flaked
- Soft-boiled egg — halved

### Standard Toppings
- 1 sheet nori — torn or cut into strips
- 5 g toasted sesame seeds
- Scallions — thinly sliced, 1–2 tbsp
- Wasabi — small dab (optional)

### Optional Add-ins
- Pickled vegetables (takuan, shibazuke, or any tsukemono)
- Furikake
- Crispy garlic or shallots
- Chili oil or togarashi for heat

## Method
1. **Heat liquid:** Bring water to boil; mix in dashi, bouillon, or steep tea.
2. **Warm rice (if cold):** Microwave 60–90 sec or pour a splash of hot water over it to loosen.
3. **Assemble:** Place rice in bowl. Arrange protein and toppings on top.
4. **Pour:** Pour hot broth over everything at the table. The broth should come about halfway up the rice.
5. **Eat immediately:** Mix as you go; rice should stay slightly textured, not porridge.

## Success criteria
- Rice softened but not mushy — distinct grains still visible
- Broth is well-seasoned (should taste good on its own)
- Toppings add texture contrast (crispy nori, tender protein)
- Warming and satisfying, not watery or bland

## Variations
- **Spicy:** Add chili oil, gochugaru, or a drizzle of your favorite hot sauce
- **Tai chazuke:** Use flaked white fish; finish with dashi broth
- **Negi-toro style:** Top with fatty tuna and extra scallions (if sashimi-grade available)
- **Leftover roast:** Great way to use batch-prepped tri-tip, pot roast, or pulled pork
- **Breakfast:** Top with soft egg and furikake; use lighter broth

## Storage & reheat
- Components store separately; assemble fresh each time
- Leftover rice: refrigerate up to 4 days, freeze up to 1 month
- Broth: make fresh (takes 30 seconds)
- Pre-cooked proteins: use within 3–4 days from batch prep

## Notes
- This is an ideal "clean out the fridge" meal — almost any leftover protein works
- Temperature matters: broth should be very hot to warm the rice properly
- If rice is very cold/stiff, warm it first or the dish will be lukewarm
- Nori should go on last and be eaten quickly before it gets soggy
